# Gesture-Recognition; Character Control; VirtualReality; Machine Learning; Real-Time; User-Defined


This project presents the initial work towards developing Gesture-Based Character Control, a gesture-recognition, and control system that allows users to record custom gestures using the Virtual Reality controllers and use it to control a characterâ€™s corresponding actions in real time. Firstly, a neural network is trained offline on an open Mocap database to distinguish between gestures and idle actionsthat the user may perform in real time. Then, during runtime, the neural network is tuned to improvedetecting gestures each time the user performs them. In this report, we present the first phase of theproject. The offline training of the system to efficiently distinguish between gestures and idle action.
